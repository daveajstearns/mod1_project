# Module 1 Final Project

# Microsoft Movie Presentation

Team Members: David Stearns and Chris Fiorentine

# Introduction

Objective is to present to a company looking to break into the field of creating original video content. Our job is to give the company a better understanding of making a movie and provide a better understanding of the movie industry through data we collect. We have collected and analized data from diffrent movie websites to give a presentation to help the company move forward in making a movie that will do well in the movie industry.

# Questions To Be Answered

* Initial data quality â€“ can we get statistically sound data?
* Are our values correlated?
* How fast are our aggregate datapoints coming together?
* Does movie popularity equate to higher revenue?
* How much does this industry have to offer?

# Steps

* Using API calls and web scrapping, collect data through various websites in the movie industry. 
* Analyze the data and make conclusions about how the data collected will help a company entering the movie indusrty. 
* Create visulizations using the data collected and analyzed to present to a board room of executives of the company. 
* Make recomendations to the company based on the data collected and conclusions that were made. 


# Data Used

We were able to collect data using an API calls and through web scrapping.

Websites used:

* www.themoviedb.org
* www.boxofficemojo.com

The types of data collected from these websites are movie titles, genres, popularity, vote counts, movie language, world-wide revenue. We analyed this data by making detailed graphs showing information that is useful to the company's decison making process. This data is vital for a company to have before making decisons about their movie. 

# Data Analysis 

Through the data we colleceted, we were able to make conclusions about what the company should prepare for before making their movie. 
* Revenue vs. Popularity
    By collecting movie renvues and movie popularity, we were able to conclude that a movie that revenue and popularity have a low correlation. So, we can inform the CEO that making a movie that is popular and makes a high total revenue is possible, however it is unlikey and the CEO should prepare for this.
* Potential Revenue
    The data we gathered showing potential revenue shows that the top grossing movies made a world-wide revenue of upwards of $2 billion. The average revenue from realeasing a move is much lower than the highest, but it shows that there is potential for a lot of money to be made in the industry.
* Vote-Count vs Popularity
    The data shows that the correlation value of a higher vote count has a good probability to equate to a more popular movie. We can conclude from this that the more exposure a movie has, the more popular it is likley to be. 
* Profit Velocity
    Profit velocity shows the amount of money made for how long the movie has been released ulitmately showing profit per day. It also shows how much money you should expect to make over a certian period of time. Another conclusion that can be made from this is that profit velocity shows what movies do well over time and have sustained success. As a CEO of a company, they can see what they should expect to make over a period of time, and what movies have sustained success and try to follow what makes them succesful.

# Recomendations

* Gather a social media team to get your movie the most exposure it can get. The more votes correlates to a higher popularity, so getting as many viewers to see your movie as possible is the first recomendation. 

* Understaning how well a movie is supposed to do against time. Using this information, CEO's can see day to day how well their movie stacks up against other movies. A company should use this information to their advantage to asses the movies success. 

# Conclusion

Through data collection, data analysis, and using data visulizations, we have concluded that a company should not enter the movie industry expecting immediate and large revenues. A substantial amount of money can be made in the indusrty however the average is much lower. We also concluded that a large vote-count has a high popularity correlation, however that does not mean a movie will do well at the box office. A movie that has a high revenue and a high popularity rating is rare and companies should be prepared for that. Finally, we have concluded that a company should invest in machine learning to find out what makes movies profitable for a long period of time.
